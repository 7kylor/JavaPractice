// Write a Java program to implement the concept of polymorphism using method
// overloading in
// class called Box. The class should have 3 instance variables called length
// and breadth and
// height. Also three setValues() methods to set initial values to the
// variables. The first set method
// has no parameters and should initialize the instance variables with some
// values. The second
// set method should have three parameters to initialize the variables using the
// values passed
// from main method. The third method should have one parameter which should be
// used to set
// the values for all the three class variables. The class should also have a
// method called as
// display() which displays the length, breadth and height of the box and also a
// message whether
// it is a normal box or a cube. Create another class that hosts the main
// method. Create an object
// of the Box class which invokes the all the three setValues() methods. Call
// the display() method
// also.
