// 5. Create a class called Animal with instance variables name and age, as well
// as methods to set and
// get the values of these variables. Then, create a subclass called Dog that
// adds additional
// instance variables breed and sound and methods to set and get their values.
// Define another
// class that hosts the main method. Inside the main method: Create a
// instance/object of the Dog
// class. Call the set and get methods using the instance/object created to
// display their
// functionality.
